#Week 01 Horiseon code refractor challenge

## Description 

- This is my first challenge of bootcamp front end web developement. I have taken a big leap and decided to learn coding. I have been motivated by the nice design and UX that is out there.
- I am to refractor the code and in accordance to the "scouts rule" to clean up the code to HTML and the CSS stylesheet.
- I have tackled this challenge in order to make the website more accessible to people who uses screen reader, so it is accessible to people with disability.
- I have done this by using semantics in the HTML file and using "alt" for image tags.
- I have learned a great deal from padding to display properties and how the webpage is setup.

üèÜ The sections listed above are the minimum for a good README, but your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't _necessary_, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, consider adding a heading called "Features" and listing them there.

## Contributing

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you will want to add guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them.
